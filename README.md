# rock-paper-scissors

Welcome to my third brainnest assignment.
I had to build a game playable from the console putting in practice basic logic concepts in order to have a rock-paper-scissors game.

Troughout of the game the browser will ask you what to choose and after 5 round we will know the winner.

Are you capable to win in my game?

Well, there is just one way to know that. click the link below ->
